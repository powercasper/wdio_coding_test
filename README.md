# Automation Test

Requirements: Node, NPM

## Instructions

* Fork this repo.
* Clone it down locally
* run `npm install`.
* run `npm test`. Only the first test should pass (which checks the title). This should verify that you are setup and good to go.
* Make all the other tests pass. Do NOT change any code inside of the actual test file.
* Improve the framework as you see fit.
* Push your completed work to your github page
* Email me (blubecker@lifesize.com) when you have completed the task and send me the URL to your account's repo (don't make a PR to the original repo). Optionally, you can send me a zip of your finished repo if that's easier.

If you have questions, email me at blubecker@lifesize.com.
